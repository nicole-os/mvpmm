    "word_count": {
        "name": "Word Count",
        "what": "Total words on your page",
        "why": "Longer content (1,500-2,500+ words) typically ranks better for competitive keywords. It signals depth and expertise to search engines and AI systems.",
        "benchmark": "Homepage: 500-1000 words. Key landing pages: 1,500-2,500 words. Blog posts: 2,000+ words for competitive topics.",
        "competitor_context": "If competitors have significantly more words, they may be providing more comprehensive coverage of topics, which search engines and AI favor."
    },
    "title_length": {
        "name": "Title Length",
        "what": "Characters in your page title tag",
        "why": "Titles are the #1 on-page SEO factor. They appear in search results and browser tabs. Too short = missed keyword opportunity. Too long = gets cut off in search results.",
        "benchmark": "Optimal: 50-60 characters. Include primary keyword near the beginning.",
        "competitor_context": "Compare title clarity and keyword usage, not just length."
    },
    "meta_description_length": {
        "name": "Meta Description Length",
        "what": "Characters in your meta description",
        "why": "While not a direct ranking factor, meta descriptions are your 'ad copy' in search results. A compelling description increases click-through rate.",
        "benchmark": "Optimal: 150-160 characters. Include a call-to-action and primary keyword.",
        "competitor_context": "Review competitor descriptions for messaging angles you might be missing."
    },
    "h1_tags": {
        "name": "H1 Headings",
        "what": "Number of H1 (main heading) tags on page",
        "why": "H1 tells search engines and AI what your page is primarily about. Best practice: exactly one H1 per page containing your primary topic/keyword.",
        "benchmark": "Exactly 1 H1 per page. Should match/reinforce the page title.",
        "competitor_context": "Multiple H1s or missing H1 indicates poor page structure."
    },
    "images_without_alt": {
        "name": "Images Missing Alt Text",
        "what": "Images without descriptive alt attributes",
        "why": "Alt text helps search engines understand images, improves accessibility, and provides another opportunity to include relevant keywords.",
        "benchmark": "0 images without alt text. Every image should have descriptive alt text.",
        "competitor_context": "This is a quick win - easy to fix and improves SEO."

    "https": {
        "name": "HTTPS Security",
        "what": "Whether your site uses secure HTTPS protocol",

        "benchmark": "100% of pages should be HTTPS.",
        "competitor_context": "If you're not on HTTPS and competitors are, you're at a disadvantage."

        "name": "XML Sitemap",
        "what": "Whether you have a sitemap.xml file",
        "why": "Sitemaps help search engines discover and index your pages faster. Essential for larger sites or sites with poor internal linking.",
        "benchmark": "Every site should have an XML sitemap submitted to Google Search Console.",
        "competitor_context": "Not having a sitemap puts you at an indexing disadvantage."

    "structured_content": {
        "name": "Structured Content",
        "what": "Whether your content uses clear heading hierarchy",
        "why": "AI systems parse content by headings. Clear H1→H2→H3 structure helps AI understand and accurately represent your content.",
        "benchmark": "Use heading hierarchy to create clear content sections. Each H2 should cover a distinct subtopic.",
        "competitor_context": "Better structured content = better AI understanding = better AI recommendations."
    },
    "faq_schema": {
        "name": "FAQ Schema Markup",

        "why": "FAQ schema can trigger rich results in Google and helps AI systems identify Q&A content for voice search and AI assistants.",
        "benchmark": "Add FAQ schema to pages with Q&A content. Use FAQPage JSON-LD format.",
        "competitor_context": "Competitors with FAQ schema may appear in 'People Also Ask' and AI responses more often."

        "name": "External Citations",
        "what": "Number of links to authoritative external sources",
        "why": "Citing sources builds credibility with both users and AI systems. It signals that your content is well-researched and trustworthy.",
        "benchmark": "Include 2-5 relevant citations per major content page to authoritative sources.",

    "citation_ready": {
        "name": "AI Citation Ready",
        "what": "Whether your content is optimized for AI systems to quote/cite",
        "why": "AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) needs quotable, factual content. Being 'citation ready' means AI can easily extract and attribute info to you.",
        "benchmark": "Combine: statistics + expert quotes + clear statements + proper attribution.",
        "competitor_context": "This is the new competitive battleground - who gets cited by AI."

        "name": "Lists & Bullet Points",
        "what": "Number of bulleted/numbered lists on page",
        "why": "Lists are easily scannable by humans AND easily extractable by AI. They often become featured snippets and AI response content.",
        "benchmark": "Use lists for features, benefits, steps, and comparisons. Aim for 3+ lists per major content page.",
